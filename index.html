    <p>Street tacos are delicious, amazing, and oh so mouthwatering! Bite into tender<br> 
    steak, zesty lime flavor with a hint of spice and add on tomatoes, avocado, and<br>
    onions for a savory bite you are going to love!</p>

    <p>These street tacos are completely jam-packed with flavor and they are so easy<br>
    to make. I love how the meat is so tender and juicy and only takes an hour to<br>
    marinate! If you absolutely love tacos like me, try out these other amazing taco<br>
    recipes! These taco-stuffed avocados, Baja fish tacos, and ground beef tacos<br>
